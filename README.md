# YOUR_FIRST_PROJECT_NAME

## Here are the guidelines for your first project :

### Stick to the plan... always stick to the plan :

Ensure that your wireframe / UI is completely designed (for smartphone AND desktop) before developing / integrating.
Here some tips for an easy and usefull design :
- Create reusable components
- Stick to a feasable number of pages
- Think about the User experience, and how to develop it, if this idea sounds too difficult for you, maybe you should keep this functionality for later in the course.

### Create branches!

-As soon as you get your repo, please create a "dev" branch.
- Use this branch ONLY for test purpose for the MVP of your web app.
- When developping start from dev and create a new branch with the following pattern "name_of-your_us_or_functionality", You will work on this branch and request a merge when done with it.

### guidelines :
- commit in English
- Commit messages must be relevent
- never put your name or other informations on branch names, they must remain anonymous for everybody willing to work with.


### Project Expectation :
